/*
    CR_fnc_setupRobberyNPCs
    Scans the mission for NPCs named "gas_station_1", "gas_station_2" and
    "gas_station_3" (as defined in the mission.sqm) and attaches an
    interaction to each. If an NPC cannot be found, a local Logic
    object will be spawned at the associated marker (if one exists)
    and used as the interaction point. This wrapper ensures that
    players have a consistent way to start a robbery regardless of
    whether ACE is loaded or not.

    Each interaction invokes CR_fnc_startRobbery on the client which
    forwards the request to the server. No conditions or distance
    checks are enforced here; those are handled by the server.

    This function should be called on each client during initClient.
